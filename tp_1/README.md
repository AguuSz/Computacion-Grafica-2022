| GL_TRIANGLES      | Treats each triplet of vertices as an independent triangle. Vertices 3n-2, 3n-1, and 3n define triangle n. N/3 triangles are drawn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP | Draws a connected group of triangles. One triangle is defined for each vertex presented after the first two vertices. For odd n, vertices n, n+1, and n+2 define triangle n. For even n, vertices n+1, n, and n+2 define triangle n. N-2 triangles are drawn.                                                                                                              |
| GL_TRIANGLE_FAN   | Draws a connected group of triangles. One triangle is defined for each vertex presented after the first two vertices. Vertices 1, n+1, and n+2 define triangle n. N-2 triangles are drawn.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| GL_QUADS          | Treats each group of four vertices as an independent quadrilateral. Vertices 4n-3, 4n-2, 4n-1, and 4n define quadrilateral n. N/4 quadrilaterals are drawn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| GL_QUAD_STRIP     | Draws a connected group of quadrilaterals. One quadrilateral is defined for each pair of vertices presented after the first pair. Vertices 2n-1, 2n, 2n+2, and 2n+1 define quadrilateral n. N/2-1 quadrilaterals are drawn. Note that the order in which vertices are used to construct a quadrilateral from strip data is different from that used with independent data. |
| GL_POLYGON        | Draws a single, convex polygon. Vertices 1 through N define this polygon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
